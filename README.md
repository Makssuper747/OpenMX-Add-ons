# OpenMX Add-ons

This is a list of all OpenMX add-ons from the [official OpenMX add-on studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29874433/).

# Install add-on from repo

### OpenMX 1-8

> Please note that apps developed on OpenMX 9 or newer will **NOT** work on OpenMX 8 running in Scratch, and apps developed for OpenMX 1-2 will **NOT** work on OpenMX 3 or newer.

1. Find the folder of the package tou want to install.
2. Download all `.sprite3` files in the folder. Don't download `index.json`, you won't need it.
3. Go inside the project and import all the downloaded sprites.

### OpenMX 9 or newer

> The older method for installing apps will still work on these versions of OpenMX although, you can use the `pkg import` terminal command to import individual app sprites without going inside the project.

1. Enter the Terminal (Start menu -> Terminal).
2. Enter the following command:

```
pkg install
```

3. Enter the name of the package you want to install. While entering it, make sure to replace spaces with `%20`.
